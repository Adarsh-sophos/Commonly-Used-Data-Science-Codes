# Commonly-Used-Data-Science-Codes

Most of the time, when you are working on a data science problem and writing code, you might face a problem like how to efficiently write a peace of code or what is the best way to do a particular task.
This repository contains all such kinds of code.

### Load an image and preprocess
```
from PIL import Image
image = Image.open(image_path)
image = Image.resize(shape)
image # show the image
```

#### Convert image into array
```
# Convert it into an array
image = np.asarray(image, dtype='float32')

# Convert it into a list of arrays
x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)

For example, if image has the shape of (100, 100, 3) then after expand_dims shape would be (1, 100, 100, 3)
```

Data that goes into neural networks should usually be normalized in some way to make it more amenable to processing by the network. (It is uncommon to feed raw pixels into a convnet.) In our case, we will preprocess our images by normalizing the pixel values to be in the [0, 1] range (originally all values are in the [0, 255] range).
In Keras this can be done via the `keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator` class using the rescale parameter. This `ImageDataGenerator` class allows you to instantiate generators of augmented image batches (and their labels) via `.flow(data, labels)` or `.flow_from_directory(directory)`. These generators can then be used with the Keras model methods that accept data generators as inputs: `fit_generator, evaluate_generator, and predict_generator`.

```
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# All images will be rescaled by 1./255
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)
test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)

# Flow training images in batches of 20 using train_datagen generator
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        train_dir,  # This is the source directory for training images
        target_size=(150, 150),  # All images will be resized to 150x150
        batch_size=20,
        # Since we use binary_crossentropy loss, we need binary labels
        class_mode='binary')

# Flow validation images in batches of 20 using test_datagen generator
validation_generator = test_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        validation_dir,
        target_size=(150, 150),
        batch_size=20,
        class_mode='binary')
```

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import img_to_array, load_img
img = load_img(img_path, target_size=(150, 150))  # this is a PIL image
x = img_to_array(img)  # Numpy array with shape (150, 150, 3)
x = x.reshape((1,) + x.shape)  # Numpy array with shape (1, 150, 150, 3)


### Evaluating Accuracy and Loss for the Model
```
history = model.fit(...)

# Retrieve a list of accuracy results on training and test data
# sets for each training epoch
acc = history.history['acc']
val_acc = history.history['val_acc']

# Retrieve a list of list results on training and test data
# sets for each training epoch
loss = history.history['loss']
val_loss = history.history['val_loss']

# Get number of epochs
epochs = range(len(acc))

# Plot training and validation accuracy per epoch
plt.plot(epochs, acc)
plt.plot(epochs, val_acc)
plt.title('Training and validation accuracy')

plt.figure()

# Plot training and validation loss per epoch
plt.plot(epochs, loss)
plt.plot(epochs, val_loss)
plt.title('Training and validation loss')
```

Overfitting happens when a model exposed to too few examples learns patterns that do not generalize to new data, i.e. when the model starts using irrelevant features for making predictions. For instance, if you, as a human, only see three images of people who are lumberjacks, and three images of people who are sailors, and among them the only person wearing a cap is a lumberjack, you might start thinking that wearing a cap is a sign of being a lumberjack as opposed to a sailor. You would then make a pretty lousy lumberjack/sailor classifier.


### Data Augmentation
Data augmentation can be done by configuring a number of random transformations to be performed on the images read by our ImageDataGenerator instance.

```
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
      rotation_range=40,
      width_shift_range=0.2,
      height_shift_range=0.2,
      shear_range=0.2,
      zoom_range=0.2,
      horizontal_flip=True,
      fill_mode='nearest')
```
These are just a few of the options available (for more, see the Keras documentation. Let's quickly go over what we just wrote:

- rotation_range is a value in degrees (0â€“180), a range within which to randomly rotate pictures.
- width_shift and height_shift are ranges (as a fraction of total width or height) within which to randomly translate pictures vertically or horizontally.
- shear_range is for randomly applying shearing transformations.
- zoom_range is for randomly zooming inside pictures.
- horizontal_flip is for randomly flipping half of the images horizontally. This is relevant when there are no assumptions of horizontal assymmetry (e.g. real-world pictures).
- fill_mode is the strategy used for filling in newly created pixels, which can appear after a rotation or a width/height shift.

img_path = os.path.join(train_cats_dir, train_cat_fnames[2])
img = load_img(img_path, target_size=(150, 150))  # this is a PIL image
x = img_to_array(img)  # Numpy array with shape (150, 150, 3)
x = x.reshape((1,) + x.shape)  # Numpy array with shape (1, 150, 150, 3)

let's apply the datagen transformations to a cat image from the training set to produce five random variants.
```
# The .flow() command below generates batches of randomly transformed images
# It will loop indefinitely, so we need to `break` the loop at some point!
i = 0
for batch in datagen.flow(x, batch_size=1):
  plt.figure(i)
  imgplot = plt.imshow(array_to_img(batch[0]))
  i += 1
  if i % 5 == 0:
    break
```
